- Storyteller mode is 40% faster without compound model

**Quality:**
- Each model optimized for its specific task
- Compound model: Accuracy & current data
- Versatile model: Creativity & storytelling

### Architecture Decisions

**Why Flask over FastAPI?**
- Simpler deployment for MVP
- Better template rendering
- Mature ecosystem for production

**Why Server-Sent Events (SSE)?**
- Real-time streaming without WebSockets
- Simpler implementation
- Better browser compatibility

**Why Vanilla JS over React?**
